## Description
This employee tracker was created as a way for managers to keep track of their employees using Console Table. 

This employee tracker allows managers to easily view their employee's name, role, department, salary, and manager by simply following a few prompts. 


## Installation
To install the dependencies required for this repository, please run the following command:

```
npm install inquirer
```


## Usage
Make sure you download all the required packages (Inquirer, Console Table, MySQL, DotEnv).
Open the file in VS code and open the Terminal. 
From there, run the command 
```
node index.js
```
Follow the prompts that appear in the terminal. When you choose a selection, the requested data will be displayed in the terminal in the form of a table. If you are wanting to add further information to the database, answer the questions when they are prompted. Once all the questions are answered, the desired table will be shown.

To quit, select Quit App, and the home screen will appear.
